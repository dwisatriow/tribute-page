      <p>Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī was a Persian polymath who produced works in mathematics, astronomy, and
        geography. Around 820 CE he was appointed as the astronomer and head of the library of the House of Wisdom
        in Baghdad. The term <em>algebra</em> itself comes from the title of his book (specifically the word
        <em>al-jabr</em> meaning "completion" or "rejoining"). His name gave rise to the terms <em>algorism</em> and
        <em>algorithm</em>.<br /><br />
        He was born into a Persian family and Ibn al-Nadim gives his birthplace as Khwarezm in Greater Khorasan
        (modern Khiva, Xorazm Region, Uzbekistan). Al-Khwārizmī accomplished most of his work in the period between
        813 and 833. After the Muslim conquest of Persia, Baghdad became the centre of scientific studies and trade.
        He worked in Baghdad as a scholar at the House of Wisdom established by Caliph al-Ma’mūn, where he studied
        the sciences and mathematics, which included the translation of Greek and Sanskrit scientific manuscripts.

      <h3>Algebra</h3>

      <p>Al-Khwarizmi's popularizing treatise on algebra (<em>The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and
          Balancing</em>, c. 813–833 CE) presented the first systematic solution of linear and quadratic
        equations. Because he was the first to treat algebra as an independent discipline and introduced the methods
        of "reduction" and "balancing", he has been described as the father or founder of algebra.</p>

      <h3>Arithmetic</h3>

      <p>In the 12th century, Latin translations of his textbook on arithmetic (<em>Algorithmo de Numero Indorum</em>)
        which codified the various Indian numerals, introduced the decimal positional number system to the Western
        world. <em>The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing</em>, translated into Latin by
        Robert of Chester in 1145, was used until the sixteenth century as the principal mathematical text-book of
        European universities.</p>

      <h3>Astronomy</h3>

      <p>Al-Khwārizmī produced a set of astronomical tables and wrote about calendaric works, as well as the astrolabe
        and the sundial. His book, <em>Zīj al-Sindhind</em> (<em>astronomical tables of Siddhanta</em>), consist of
        approximately 37 chapters on calendrical and astronomical calculations and 116 tables with calendrical,
        astronomical and astrological data, as well as a table of sine values. The work contains tables for the
        movements of the sun, the moon and the five planets known at the time. This work marked the turning point in
        Islamic astronomy.</p>

      <h3>Trigonometry</h3>

      <p>He also made important contributions to trigonometry, producing accurate sine and cosine tables, and the
        first table of tangents. Al-Khwārizmī's <em>Zīj al-Sindhind</em> contained tables for the trigonometric
        functions of sines and cosine. A related treatise on spherical trigonometry is also attributed to him.</p>

      <p>In addition to his best-known works, he revised Ptolemy's <em>Geography</em>, listing the longitudes and
        latitudes of various cities and localities. Al-Khwārizmī's third major work is his <em>Kitāb Sūrat
          al-Ard</em> (Book of the Description of the Earth), also known as his Geography, which was finished in
        833. It is a major reworking of Ptolemy's 2nd-century Geography, consisting of a list of 2402 coordinates of
        cities and other geographical features following a general introduction.</p>
